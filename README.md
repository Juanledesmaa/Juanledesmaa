### Hi there 👋

<img height="250" width="500" alt="GIF" align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19560736/229314409-9fd5c7bd-dddd-4160-aeb0-c1a805bea42d.gif">


🤓 I'm an iOS developer.

🎯 Goal: Pursue a career path as a Tech Lead with a focus on Architecture.

👨‍💻 Skilled in: Swift, Objetive-C, SwiftUI, MVP, MVVM-C, and Reactive programming (RXSwift).

🎨 Good understanding of Apple's design principles and interface guidelines, because we like to play by the rules. 

🚀 I Love to learn and make use of automation tools CI/CD pipelines, because manual testing is so last year. 

🎮 Game development is one of my favorite hobbies.

💻 If you're interested in learning more about my side projects or collaborating with me, don't be shy! Head to https://www.juanledesma.me/ and let's chat!
